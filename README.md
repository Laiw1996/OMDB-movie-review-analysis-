### This project explores the various factors that determines the success of a movie.

- Q1.py is about exploring the question: 
<br>Do the various criteria for success (critic reviews, audience reviews, profit/loss) correlate with each other? 
<br>Run the code as follows: 
  python3 Q1.py rotten-tomatoes.json.gz 
- Q2.py is about exploring the question:
<br> Can you predict review scores from other data we have about the movie? Maybe genre determines a lot about the success or a movie? Or maybe the actors?
- Q3.ipynb, Q3-A.ipynb and Q4.ipynb should be run in Jupyter as they are.
- Q5.py should be run as follows: python3 Q5.py wikidata-movies.json.gz rotten-tomatoes.json.gz genres.json.gz
